# Tower Classifier

Django based web app that classifies user input images of the [CN Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower), [Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree) or [The Space Needle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Needle) through a CNN deployed through Google Cloud Functions. 

The notebook [lesson1.ipynb](https://github.com/jkennedy559/course-v3/blob/master/assignments%20/lesson1.ipynb) shows the model training, using [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) and the model can be found [here](https://github.com/jkennedy559/course-v3/blob/master/assignments%20/data/towers/export.pkl).
